# Capstone-1-Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis
Google Play, formerly known as Android Market, is the official distribution storefront for Android applications and other digital media, such as music, movies and books, from Google. It is available on mobile devices and tablets that run the Android operating system (OS), supported Chrome OS devices and on the web. Users can access Google Play to browse, purchase and download software applications from Google and third-party developers.

In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We’ll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. This data set have two csv file:
• Play store apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
• user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
